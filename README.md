# ATS-Anairiats
Hosting ATS-Anairiats at Github

Originally, ATS-Anairiats was hosted at
sourceforge.net:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats-lang/

Note that ATS-Anairiats is needed to compile ATS-Positats.
  
ATS-Anairiats is referred to as ATS1, which is written in ATS1
itself. There is another implementation of ATS given the name
ATS-Geizella, which is written in OCaml. ATS-Anairiats was first
compiled by ATS-Geizella and then compiled by itself.

ATS-Postiats is referred to as ATS2, which is written in ATS1
as well.

ATS-Temptory is a template-based repackaging of ATS-Postiats.
It is considered an experiment on template-based programming
and a precursor of ATS-Xanadu.

ATS-Xanadu is referred to as ATS3, which is currently under
active development. ATS-Xanadu is written in ATS2 and is so far
a dream that is yet to be realized. Please keep tuned :)
