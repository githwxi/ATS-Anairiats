\chapter{Interaction with C}\label{chapter:interaction_with_c} As ATS and C
share precisely the same data representation, interaction between ATS and C
is mostly done in a straightforward manner.  However, it should be
emphasized that type safety can be compromised due to such interaction,
and thus it is suggested that this be done with great caution.

\section{External C Code}
A function declaration may attach an external name to the declared
function, allowing it to be referred to outside ATS. In
Figure~\ref{figure:fact_extern_function_1}, ${\it fact}$ is declared to
be a function from integers to integers.  This function is given an
external name ${\it fact\_extern}$.  In ATS, extern C code is allowed to
appear inside the following special pairs of parentheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb`%{` and \verb`}%`: The C code enclosed by this pair is to be
relocated to somewhere (unspecified) in the code generated from compiling
the file containing the C code.
\item \verb`%{^` and \verb`}%`:
The C code enclosed by this pair is to be relocated to the top of the
code generated from compiling the file containing the C code.
\item \verb`%{$` and \verb`}%`:
The C code enclosed by this pair is to be relocated to the bottom of the
code generated from compiling the file containing the C code.
\end{itemize}
In Figure~\ref{figure:fact_extern_function_1}, a function of the name {\it
fact\_extern} is implemented in C. Note that the type ${\it
ats\_int\_type}$ in C is the counterpart of the type $\tint$ in ATS.  When
the code in Figure~\ref{figure:fact_extern_function_1} is compiled, the
call to ${\it fact}$ (on the integer 10) in ATS is translated to a call to
${\it fact\_extern}$. It may be helpful if the reader compiles this example
and then takes a look at the emitted C code.

In Figure~\ref{figure:fact_extern_function_2}, the function {\it fact} is
implemented in ATS. When compiled, this implementation is translated into
an implementation of ${\it fact\_extern}$ in C.  The function {\it main} in
ATS is given the external name {\it mainats}.  In
Figure~\ref{figure:fact_extern_function_2}, a function of this name is
implemented in C, where a call to {\it fact\_extern} is made. Note that the
type ${\it ats\_void\_type}$ in C is the counterpart of the type ${\it
void}$ in ATS.  Also, a function ${\it main\_dummy}$ is implemented in
Figure~\ref{figure:fact_extern_function_2}.  The sole purpose for this
implementation is to indicate to the ATS compiler (atsopt) that ${\it
mainats}$ is implemented externally.

\begin{figure}
\input{DATS/external_list0_length_function.dats}
\caption{An implementation of the list length function in C}
\label{figure:external_list0_length_function}
\end{figure}
The code in Figure~\ref{figure:external_list0_length_function} gives
another typical use of external C code. In this example, the functions
${\it list0\_is\_nil}$ and ${\it list0\_tail}$ are both implemented in
ATS, but the function ${\it list0\_length}$ is implemented in C.

\section{External Types}
Suppose that the name {\it someType} refers to some type declared in C.  Then
this type can be referred to as {\it \$extype "someType"} in ATS. On the
other hand, one can introduce external names for types in ATS and then use
such names outside ATS. For instance, an external name {\it
int\_int\_pair} is introduced in the following code to refer to the type
{\it @(int, int)}:
\begin{verbatim}
extern typedef "int_int_pair" = @(int, int)
\end{verbatim}
In this case, ${\it int\_int\_pair}$ is essentially bound to a struct type
in C as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct {
  ats_int_type atslab_0 ; ats_int_type atslab_1 ;
} int_int_pair ;
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb`atslab_` is the prefix used by the ATS compiler to form
labels for field selection.

\begin{figure}
\input{DATS/external_list0_append_function.dats}
\caption{An implementation of the list append function in C}
\label{figure:external_list0_append_function}
\end{figure}
Suppose that $v$ is a value of the form $C(v_1,\ldots, v_n)$, where $C$ is
a constructor associated with some datatype and $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ are values
of types $T_1,\ldots, T_n$, respectively. The value $v$ is represented by a
pointer to some struct when compiled into C, and the type of this pointer
can be referred to as $C\_{\it pstruct}(T_1,\ldots, T_n)$ in ATS. As an
example, the funtion for appending two lists together is implemented
externally in Figure~\ref{figure:external_list0_append_function}. The
reader may want to compile this example and then carefully inspect the
emitted C code.

\section{External Values}
Suppose that the name {\it someValue} refers to some value in C. Then this
value can be referred to as {\it \$extval ($T$, "someValue")}, where $T$ is
the perceived type of this value in ATS. For instance, {\it stdin\_ref} is
defined as a macro in ATS:
\begin{verbatim}
macdef stdin_ref = $extval (FILEref, "stdin")
\end{verbatim}
where ${\it FILEref}$ is a type in ATS that approximately corresponds to
the type ${\it FILE*}$ in C. Given that ATS does not support {\it enum}
types directly, this approach to accessing within ATS values defined in C
also makes it straightforward to define {\it enum} types in C and then use
them in ATS.

On the other hand, one can introduce external
names for values in ATS and then use such names outside ATS. For instance,
an external name {\it one\_one\_pair} is introduced in the following code
to refer to the value {\it @(1, 1)}:
\begin{verbatim}
extern val "one_one_pair" = @(1, 1)
\end{verbatim}
Note that each external value is registered as a global root for the
garbage collector in case garbagage collection is performed at run-time.
