The type system of ATS can currently track the following list of effects
that a program may incur during its execution:

<UL>

<LI>
The <i>exn</i> (exception) effect is incurred if a program raises an
exception during its execution. This covers the case where the execution of
a program is terminated abnormally, for instance, by calling <i>exit</i>.

<LI>
The <i>ntm</i> (nontermination) effect refers to potential nonterminating
excecution of a program.

<LI>
The <i>ref</i> (reference) effect essentially means that a program may
potentially update the content of some shared memory.

</UL>
