The command for compiling ATS programs is
<i>atscc</i>, which is stored in the directory "$ATSHOME/bin/" after
ATS/Anairiats is installed. The ATS compiler translates ATS programs into C
code, which is then compiled by the GNU C compiler <i>gcc</i>. 
<P>
<i>atscc</i> accepts all the flags <i>gcc</i> recognizes and passes them to
<i>gcc</i> directly. The following is a list of flags that are special
to <i>atscc</i>:
<UL>
<LI> The flag <i>--atstc</i> or <i>-tc</i> indicates typechecking only.
<LI> The flag <i>--atscc</i> or <i>-cc</i> indicates compiling to C code only.
<LI> The flag <i>-D_ATS_GCATS</i> indicates the need for garbage collection.
</UL>
If a C compiler other than <i>gcc</i> is to be used, please
set the environment variable <i>ATSCCOMP</i> to the command name of
this C compiler.
<P>
As an example, the following command only typechecks the ATS code in
"foo.dats" and "bar.sats":

<pre>
atscc -tc foo.dats bar.sats
</pre>

while the following command compiles "foo.dats" and "bar.sats"
into "foo_dats.c" and "bar_sats.c", respectively, if typechecking
"foo.dats" and bar.sats" succeeds:

<pre>
atscc -cc foo.dats bar.sats
</pre>

Typically, <i>atscc</i> is used as follows:

<pre>
atscc -o foobar -O3 foo.dats bar.sats
</pre>

When this command is issued, <i>atscc</i> first generates "foo_dats.c" and
"bar_sats.c", and then invokes <i>gcc</i> to compile
"foo_dats.c" and "bar_sats.c" to generate an executable file named
"foobar". The flag "-O3" requires that <i>gcc</i> perform all optimizations
classified at level 3 or below.

We may also issue the following command to produce some debugging information
for tools like gdb and <a href="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</a>:

<pre>
atscc -o foobar -g foo.dats bar.sats
</pre>

ATS programs can run with or without (systematic) garbage collection.  If
garbage collection is needed, then the following command can be issued to
generate the executable "foobar":

<pre>
atscc -o foobar -O3 foo.dats bar.sats -D_ATS_GCATS 
</pre>

<P>
For your information, the command <i>atscc</i> is not implemented in a
scripting language. It is one of the very first programs implemented in
ATS/Geizella (and then ported to ATS/Anairiats). The code for <i>atscc</i>
(and several other commands) can be found at <A
HREF="https://ats-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ats-lang/trunk/utils/scripts/">utils/scripts/</A>.
