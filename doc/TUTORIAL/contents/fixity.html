Given a function <i>f</i> of arity <i>n</i>, the standard syntax for
applying <i>f</i> to <i>n</i> arguments <i>v_1</i>, ..., <i>v_n</i> is
<i>f(v_1, ..., v_n)</i>. It is, however, allowed in ATS to use infix
notation for a binary function application, and prefix or postifix notation
for a unary function application.
<P>

In ATS, each identifier can be assigned one of the following fixities:
prefix, infix and postfix.  The fixity declarations for many commonly used
identifiers can be found in <A
HREF="http://www.ats-lang.org/IMPLEMENTATION/Anairiats/ATS/prelude/fixity.ats">prelude/fixity.ats</A>.
We often use the name <i>operator</i> to refer to an identifier that is
assigned a fixity.
<P>

For instance, we use the following syntax to declare that <i>+</i> and
<i>-</i> are infix operators of precedence value 50:

<pre>
infixl 50 + -
</pre>

After this declaration, we can write an expression
like <i>1 + 2 - 3</i>, which is parsed into
<i>-(+(1, 2), 3)</i> in terms of the standard syntax for function
application.

The keyword <i>infixl</i> indicates that the declared infix operators are
left-associative. For right-associative and non-associative infix
operators, please use the keywords <i>infixr</i> and <i>infix</i>,
respectively. If the precedence value is omitted in a fixity declaration,
it is assumed to equal 0.
<P>

We can also use the following syntax to declare that
<i>iadd</i>, <i>fadd</i>, <i>padd</i> and <i>uadd</i> are left-associative
infix operators with a precedence value equal to that of the operator
<i>+</i>:

<pre>
infixl (+) iadd fadd padd uadd
</pre>

This is useful as it is difficult in practice to remember the precedence
values of (a large collection of) declared operators. Sometimes, we may
need to specify that the precedence value of one operator in relation to
that of another one. For instance, the following syntax declares that
<i>opr2</i> is a left-associative infix operator and its precedence value
is that of <i>opr1</i> plus 10:

<pre>
infixl (opr1 + 10) opr2
</pre>

If the plus sign (+) is changed to the minus sign (-), then the precedence
value of <i>opr2</i> is that of <i>opr1</i> minus 10.
<P>

We can also turn an identifier <i>opr</i> into a non-associative infix
operator (of precedence value 0) by putting the backslash symbol <i>\</i>
in front of it. For instance, the expression
<i>$exp_1 \opr $exp_2</i> stands for <i>opr ($exp_1, $exp_2)</i>, where
<i>$exp_1</i> and <i>$exp_2</i>
refer to some expressions, either static or dynamic.
<P>

The syntax for declaring (unary) prefix and postfix operators are
similar. For instance, the following syntax declares that
<i>~</i> and <i>?</i> are prefix and postfix operators
of precedence values 61 and 69, respectively:

<pre>
prefix 61 ~
postfix 69 ?
</pre>

Please find an example involving a postfix operator <A
HREF="fixity.dats">here</A>.
<P>

For a given occurrence of an operator, we can deprive it of its assigned
fixity by simply putting the keyword <i><u>op</u></i> in front of it. For
instance <i>1 + 2 - 3</i> can be writen as <i><u>op</u>- (<u>op</u>+ (1,
2), 3)</i>.  It is also possible to (permanently) deprive an operator of its
assigned fixity.  For instance, the following syntax does so to the
operators
<i>iadd</i>, <i>fadd</i>, <i>padd</i> and <i>uadd</i>:

<pre>
nonfix iadd fadd padd uadd
</pre>

Lastly, please note that fixity declarations are lexically scoped, and each
fixity declaration is only effective within its legal scope.
