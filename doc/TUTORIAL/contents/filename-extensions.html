In ATS, we use the filename extensions ".sats" and ".dats" to indicate
static and dynamic files, respectively. These two extensions have
some special meaning attached to them and thus should not be replaced
arbitrarily.
<P>

A static file may contain sort definitions, datasort declarations, static
definitions, abstract type declarations, exception declarations, datatype
declarations, macro definition, interfaces for dynamic values and
functions, etc.  In terms of functionality, a static file in ATS is similar
to a header file (with the extension ".h") in C or an interface file (with
the extension ".mli") in Objective Caml.
<P>

A dynamic file may contain everything in a static file. In addition, it may
also contain defintions for dynamic values and functions.
<P>

In general, the syntax for constructing code in a static file can also be
used for constructing code in a dynamic file. The only exception involves
declaring interfaces for dynamic values and functions. For instance, in a
<em>static</em> file, we can use the following syntax to declare interfaces
(or types) for a value named <i>pi</i> and a function named
<i>area_of_circle</i>.

<pre>
val pi : double
fun area_of_circle (radius: double): double
</pre>

When doing the same thing in a <em>dynamic</em> file, we need to use the
following slightly different syntax:

<pre>
extern val pi : double
extern fun area_of_circle (radius: double): double
</pre>

where <i>extern</i> is a keyword in ATS.
<P>

As a convention, we often use the filename extension ".cats" to indicate
that a file contains some C code that is supposed to be combined with ATS
code in certain manner. However, the use of this filename extension is not
mandatory.
