Templates</A></H2>

<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=LEFT><P>

Parametric polymorphism (or polymorphism for short) offers a flexible and
effective approach to supporting code reuse. For instance, given a pair
<i>(v1, v2)</i> where <i>v1</i> is a a boolean and <i>v2</i> a character,
the function
<i>swap_bool_char</i> defined below returns a pair <i>(v2, v1)</i>:

<pre>
fun swap_bool_char (xy: @(bool, char)): @(char, bool) = (xy.1, xy.0)
</pre>

Now suppose that a pair of integers need to be swapped, and this results in
the implementation of the following function <i>swap_int_int</i>:

<pre>
fun swap_int_int (xy: @(int, int)): @(int, int) = (xy.1, xy.0)
</pre>

The code duplication between <i>swap_bool_char</i> and
<i>swap_int_int</i> is obvious, and it can be easily avoided by implementing a
function template as follows:

<pre>
fun{a,b:t@ype} swap (xy: @(a, b)): @(b, a) = (xy.1, xy.0)
</pre>

Now the functions <i>swap_bool_char</i> and <i>swap_int_int</i> can
simply be replaced with <i>swap&lt;bool,char&gt;</i> and
<i>swap&lt;int,int&gt;</i>, respectively. The function template
<i>swap</i> cannot be compiled into executable binary code directly as the sizes
of type variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are unknown: The special sort
<i>t@ype</i> is for classifying types whose sizes are unspecified. If
<i>swap&lt;T1,T2&gt;</i> is used for some types <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> of known
sizes, then an instantiation of <i>swap</i> is created where type variables
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are replaced with <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i>,
respectively, and then compiled into executable binary code. For those who
know the feature of templates in C++, this should sound rather familiar.

In contrast to <i>swap</i>, <i>swap_type_type</i> is defined below as a
polymorphic function (rather than a function template):

<pre>
fun swap_type_type {a,b:type} (xy: @(a, b)): @(b, a) = (xy.1, xy.0)
</pre>

This function can be compiled into executable binary code as the sizes of
type variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are known: The special sort <i>type</i> is for
classifying types whose sizes equal exactly one word, that is, the size of
a pointer. For example, the size of a string is one word, and the size of
any declared datatype is also one word.  Given strings <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i>, an
application of <i>swap_type_type</i> to <i>@(s1, s2)</i> can be written as
follows:

<pre>
swap_type_type {string,string} @(s1, s2)
</pre>

where the expression <i>{string,string}</i> is often referred to as a static
argument. As in this case, most static arguments do not have to be provided
explicitly since they can be automatically inferred.  However, such static
arguments, if provided, can often enhance the quality and precision of the
error messages reported in case of typechecking failure. This is a topic to
be explored elsewhere in great depth.

<H4>Template Declaration and Implementation</H4>

Often, the interface for a template may need to be declared alone.  For
instance, the interface for the above <i>swap</i> function template can be
declared as follows:

<pre>
extern fun{a,b:t@ype} swap (xy: @(a, b)): @(b, a)
</pre>

Just like a declared function interface, a declared template interface can
be implemented.  For instance, the following code implements the interface
declared for the <i>swap</i> function template:

<pre>
implement{a,b} swap (xy) = (xy.1, xy.0)
</pre>

This form of template implementation is often referred to as generic
template implementation in contrast to specialized template implementation
presented as follows.

It is also allowed to implement specialized templates in ATS. For instance,
the following code implements the above <i>swap</i> function template that
is specialized with the type variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> being set to
<i>int</i> and <i>int</i>, respectively:

<pre>
implement swap&lt;int,int&gt; (xy) = let
  val x = xy.0 and y = xy.1; val s = x + y in (s - x, s - y)
end // end of [swap&lt;int,int&gt;]
</pre>
