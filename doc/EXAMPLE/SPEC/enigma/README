// HX: Trying to implement an ENIGMA simulator by following SE principles
*)

Time: 5-7 August, 2011

I have to say that I did not acquire a good understanding of ENIGMA after
studying the VDM specification of ENIGMA. I found a paper ENIGMA machine
on-line and played it. Afterwards, I specified various functions in
enigma.sats and then did the implementation (enigma.dats). It all went
smoothly.

Unfortunately, the rotor implementation was not correct (due to my
inadequate understanding of the rotor mechanism). I then gave an algebraic
specification of a rotor and fixed the problem.

Overall, I do not feel that VDM is particularly effective when applied to
this example.
