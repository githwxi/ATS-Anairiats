ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.9:

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes. The most notable
addition is a package named 'parworkshop' in $ATSHOME/libats, which
provides some rudimentary support for multicore programming (SMP).
Please see $ATSHOME/doc/EXAMPLE/MULTICORE for some examples.

(*
// this feature is retracted as it is difficult to support
1. overloaded symbols in a macro definition is re-loaded when the macro
   definition is expanded. This change can greatly facilitate the use of
   macros defined in $ATSHOME/prelude/macrodef.sats

2. macro expansion is now handled by [d1exp_tr] in [ats_trans2_dyn1.dats]
   (instead of being done by [d2exp_tr] in [ats_trans3_dyn2.dats])
*)

3. The semantics for symbol overloading is greatly simplified.

4. Adding libc/sched based on /usr/include/sched.x

5. Adding libats/parworkshop to support multicore programming.

6. The examples in doc/EXAMPLE/MULTICORE are modified to run again.

7. Adding support for lliunt and ullint.
