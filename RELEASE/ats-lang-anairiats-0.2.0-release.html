ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.0:

This is a milestone release. The original plan for OOP support in ATS has
been scratched completely, resulting in about 1500 lines of code being
removed. Instead, some support is added to interface ATS with external code
written in OOP-style.

The following libraries are now available for use:

contrib/glib
contrib/cairo
contrib/pango
contrib/X11
contrib/GTK
contrib/GL (OpenGL, GLU and GLUT)
contrib/SDL

Much more effort is needed to expand the APIs for these libraries. So far,
only the API for cairo is close to completion.
