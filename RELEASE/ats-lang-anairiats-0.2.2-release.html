As usual, this release contains a large number of fixes. Also, many new
coding examples are added. Compared to the previous version, the ATS
interface for libc functions is greatly extended, and there are now many
examples involving systems programming that are available in the following
directory:

$ATSHOME/doc/EXAMPLES/AUP/.

A (partial) list of the changes since the last release are given as
follows:

1. -D_ATS_TERMINATION_CHECK is changed to -D_ATS_PROOFCHECK; fixing a
   related bug in [d3explst_funarg_tr].
2. Fixing a bug involving type-checking variadic functions
3. Fixing a bug involving solving top-level constraints
4. $ATSHOME/libc/SATS/complex.sats and $ATSHOME/libc/DATS/complex.dats
   are compiled and then added to libats.a
5. Adding support for #undef
6. Thoroughly testing the support for ATS running on Cygwin
7. Implementing libats/vector (dynamically resizable vectors)
8. $ATSHOME may now contain the space character (' ').
9. Fixing a bug involving mishandling of proofs during proof erasure
   (ats_trans4)
10. Fixing a bug involving mishandling negative long integers
11. Adding rarray (reversed array) implementation
12. Adding libc/pwd, which correspond to pwd.h
13. Adding libc/grp, which correspond to grp.h
14. Adding libc/termios, which corresponds to termios.h
15. Adding libc/curses, which corresponds to curses.h

18. Adding libc/ctype, which corresponds to ctype
19. Adding libc/DATS/stdio.dats
20. Modifying the types for malloc_ngc and free_ngc
21. Clearing up libc/pthread and libc/pthread_uplock
22. Implementing lib/pthread_upbarr
23. Incorporating [parcomb] into $ATSHOME/contrib
24. Adding libc/sys/resource, which corresponds to sys/resource.h
