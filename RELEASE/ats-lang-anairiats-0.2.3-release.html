ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.3:

As usual, this release contains a large number of fixes. There is
also a lot effort going into documentation. In particular, the grammar
of ATS (ats_grammar.yats) is cleaned considerably.

A (partial) list of the changes since the last release are given as
follows:

1. Adding READ: READ(string) is read-only!
2. Renaming prelude/?ATS/file.?ats to prelude/?ATS/filebas.?ats
3. Adding support -DATS flags: -DATSXYZ=12345 or -DATS XYZ=12345
4. Adding support for ATS/Anairiats to output #line pragma in the C code
   generated by atsopt.
5. Adding support for compiling fixed-point expressions (constructed via
   fix and @fix).
6. Introducing various macros in ccomp/runtime/ats_basics.h to give more
   structure to the C code generated by atsopt.
7. Introducing block expressions: { decseq_syn }
8. Supporting syndef-loaded external identifers
9. DO and WHILE are external ids: both while-loop and do-while-loop are
   supported.
10. print! and println! are now supported.
11. fprint! and fprintln! are now supported.
12. tupz! is now supported.
13. $ATSHOME/utils/atsgrammar is added for documenting the grammar of ATS.
14. Implementing the $ATSHOME/libats/fundeque_fingertree package.
15. "><" (GTLT) can now be used as a dynamic identifier.
16. Syntax like [val <pat> = <SomeProof>] is now ruled out: 'val' needs to be
    replaced with 'prval'.
17. Removing named types (S2Enamed), which is inadequate for its purpose
18. S2Eextype can now carry arguments
19. overhauling partial template implementation
20. ptrout -> vptrout and ptroutopt -> vptroutopt
21. ptropt_v -> optvar_v
22. [ptrself] is introduced as a named type of the name "ats_ptrself_type"
23. The '$fun' suffix is no longer in use. If a function is declared using
    the keyword 'val', then the function is treated just like an ordinary value.
