ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.6:

As usual, this release contains a large number of bug fixes. Some of the
significant changes are listed as follows:

1. Support for OOP is under development. So far, typechecking is done.

2. Type error message reporting is made more informative. This is ongoing.

3. Adding $ATSHOME/ccomp/lib64 for storing libfiles for 64-bit machines.

4. The Makefile in $ATSHOME is re-designed by Likai Liu. It now allows
   ATS to be installed in a selected directory. Just issue the following
   command before calling 'make':

./configure --prefix=&lt;DESTDIR&gt;

   where &lt;DESTDIR&gt; is the directory for final installation. After 'make'
   is done, please call 'make install'.
