ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.8:

As usual, this release contains a few fixes. A (partial) list of the
changes since the last release is given as follows:

1. Fixing a bug involving assumed abstract types.
2. Adding list_mapopt_* functions.
3. Packaging libatsdoc into ATS-0.2.8
4. Packaging utils/atsdoc into ATS-0.2.8
5. Adding contrib/mysql
6. Adding contrib/jansson (mostly based on previous work by Chris Double)

ATS2 has been under active development for more than a year, and it is
expected to be released by the end of year 2012. However, ATS will be
maintained long after the release of ATS2. In particular, ATS will be
relied upon to bootstrap ATS2 for quite some time into the future. For
the users of ATS, please be assured that the transition from ATS to ATS2
is anticipated to be a smooth one requiring only minimal effort.
