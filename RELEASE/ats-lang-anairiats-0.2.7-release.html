ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.7:

As usual, this release contains a few fixes. A (partial) list of the changes
since the last release is given as follows:

1. free_gc_viewt0ype_addr_view -> free_gc_t0ype_addr_view
   free_gc_viewt0ype_int_addr_view -> free_gc_t0ype_int_addr_view
2. ptr_free and array_ptr_free: interface change
3. Adding funheap_binomial and linheap_binomial
4. Adding libats/SATS/bimatrix.sats. Thanks to Artyom!
5. The s2exp_syneq function (syn. eq.) now employs eta-expansion
6. !READ(string) -> string (SHARED is introduced to do the opposite)
7. Adding libats/lockptr_spin and libats/lockref_spin (spinlocks)
8. The docbook source for the ATS intro book is now included.
9. The closures in each infile object are made to be linear and they
   are freed when the infile object is freed.
10. The compiler now generates code to prevent an abstract type from
    being implemented (assumed) more than once.
11. && and || are now macros (long overdue!)
12. The libats/ngc/linmap_pavltree package is added. Kudos to Artyom!
13: Adding libats/funmset_listord (functional multiset implementation)
14: Fixing a bug involving tailcall optimization (argument movement)
15: Fixing a minor bug involving p2at_arg_tr.
16: The interface for pthread creating in ATS is slightly modified.

ATS2 has been under active development for more than a year, and it is
expected to be released by the end of year 2012. However, ATS will be
maintained long after the release of ATS2. In particular, ATS will be
relied upon to bootstrap ATS2 for quite some time into the future. For
the users of ATS, please be assured that the transition from ATS to ATS2
is anticipated to be a smooth one requiring only minimal effort.
