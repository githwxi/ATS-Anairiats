ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.1:

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes. Also, many
new coding examples are added.

1. The support for 'atsopt --depgen' is revamped.
2. The support for boolean patterns is made available.
3. Most string-generating functions now return linear strings
   (strptr). This is a change that can have pervasive impact.
