ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.10:

The primary purpose of this release is to push out a version of ATS that
can be used to compile ATS2, the successor of ATS that is planned to be
released by the end of August, 2013.

In this version of ATS, various packages in ${ATSHOME}/contrib (e.g., glib
and GTK) are no longer compiled automatically. If needed, please use the
provided Makefiles to compile them manually.

For the current users of ATS, it is time to make a swtich to ATS2. I
certainly hope that you will be able to unleash the great potentials of the
type system and template system of ATS2. Happy programming!

Happy programming!
