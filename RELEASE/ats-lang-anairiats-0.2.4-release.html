ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.4:

As usual, this release contains a large number of fixes. A (partial) list
of the changes since the last release is given as follows:

1. Adding the package contrib/testing to facilitate construction of
   testing code.
2. Adding support for value templates.
3. Adding various examples in doc/EXAMPLE/PCPV to demonstrate a style
   of program verification that is described as being programmer-centric.
4. Adding the package contrib/scripting to support scripting in ATS.
5. Bison is now the default tool for generate [ats_grammar_yats.c].
6. Adding some functions in prelude/list.
7. Adding some functions in prelude/lazy_vt.
8. ATS/Anairiats is kept up-to-date for bootstrapping.
9. $ATSHOME/contrib/glib/glist: overhauling many function interfaces.
10. The file ats_fixity.dats is splitted into the following two files:
    ats_fixity_prec.dats and ats_fixity_fxty.dats.
11. Adding some functions for parsing various syntax trees.
12. Renaming various 'get' and 'set' functions according to some adopted
    naming convention.
13. Starting to build API in $ATSHOME/contrib/linux for supporting linux
    kernel programming. This is going to be a long journey!
14: Renaming: fun__main -> funenv
    Renaming: fun_tsz__main -> funenv_tsz
    Renaming: clo_tsz__main -> cloenv_tsz
    Renaming: __main -> _funenv (for various higher-order functions)
15: matrix_v (a, m, n, l) is now defined as mtrxt (a, m, n) @ l
16: stack-allocated closures are now statically allocated (instead of
    being dynamically allocated via alloca) (svn-version: 2519)
17: prelude/array and prelude/matrix have been cleaned up considerably
18: naming change: "#foo" -> "mac#foo" (for external macros)
19: using names like "sta#foo" to support external static functions
20: adding contrib/linux to support linux kernel programming (very long term)
21: adding libats/ngc/deque_arr
22: basing libats/linqueue_arr and libats/linstack_arr on libats/ngc/deque_arr
24. ATSstaticdec() and ATSglobaldec() are now employed in emitted C code
    for indicating whether a function is global or static.
25. reloading a pervasive .sats file is allowed; doing so is like a no-op.
