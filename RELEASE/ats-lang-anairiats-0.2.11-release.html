ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.11:

The primary purpose of this release is to push out a version of ATS
that can be used to compile ATS2, the successor of ATS. It is planned
that the development of ATS is to be freezing gradually. In general,
only changes that help the development of ATS2 can be chosen to be added
into ATS.

For the current users of ATS, it is about the time to make a swtich to
ATS2.  As always, I certainly hope that you will be able to unleash the
great potentials of the type system and template system of ATS2.

Happy programming!
