ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.6:

As usual, this release contains many fixes. A (partial) list of the changes
since the last release is given as follows:

1. Adding contrib/JNI for interfacing ATS and Java.
2. Adding the --xrefprelude flag to make cross-referencing work again.
3. The keyword [sta] can now also be written as [stacst].
4. If a name refers to several static constants, then the latest declared
   non-functional one is chosen (if there is one).
5. The tutorial (doc/TUTORIAL) is no longer put into the release package.
6. Allowing #FILENAME and #LOCATION to be used as e0xp. For instance, the
   following line is now legal:
   #print (#FILENAME)
7. Fixing a bug related to xref that caused illegal xhtml files to be
   generated (cases of A elements being embedded inside another A element).
   Thanks, David!
8. Introducing ISALIGNED to handle alignment.
9. Introducing NULLABLE to handle ptr_zero and ptr_zero_tsz.
10. Adding libats/funmap_rbtree (functional maps based on red-black trees)
11. Adding contrib/gtkglext (based on gtkglext-1.0)
12. Adding contrib/atspslide for doing slide presentation and other things.
13: Adding libc/gdbm/gdbm (API for gdbm in ATS).
14: Adding libc/gdbm/ndbm (API for gdbm-ndbm in ATS).
15: Adding libats/ngc/DATS/dlist.dats. Thanks to Artyom!
16: [atslib] can now process flags for each individual file. See .libfiles.
17: pervasive changes: free_gc_v (T, ...) => free_gc_v (T?, ...)

In this release, there are some changes to the interfaces of various
library functions, which may require some minor modifications (mostly type
annotations) to application programs using these functions. Sorry about
this!
