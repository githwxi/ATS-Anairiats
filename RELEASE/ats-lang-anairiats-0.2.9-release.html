ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.9:

As usual, this release contains a few fixes. A (partial) list of the
changes since the last release is given as follows:

1. Fixing some macros in ccomp/runtime/ats_exception.h
2. Removing the field tmpvar_root in tmpvar and related functions.
3. Adding support for using CMake to build projects written in ATS.
   Kudos to Hanwen!
4. $showtype support for debugging is added (2012-11-24)
5. Adding libats/linmap_skiplist for linear maps based on skip-lists.
6. ((<exp1>, ..., <exp2>)) -> @(<exp1>, ..., <exp2>)
7. If the assigned external name of a function is empty, then its
   internal name should be used in the place where its external name
   is needed. For example, the following declarations are equivalent:
   fun foo (x: int): void = "ext#"
   fun foo (x: int): void = "ext#foo"
   The following two are equivalent as well:
   fun bar (x: int): void = "mac#"
   fun bar (x: int): void = "mac#bar"

ATS2 has been under active development for more than one and one-half
years, and it is expected to be released by Summer 2013. However,
ATS will be maintained long after the release of ATS2. In particular, ATS
will be relied upon to bootstrap ATS2 for quite some time into the
future. For the users of ATS, please be assured that the transition from
ATS to ATS2 is anticipated to be a smooth one requiring only minimal
effort.
