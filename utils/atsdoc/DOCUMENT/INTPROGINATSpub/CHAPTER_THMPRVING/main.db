<title>Theorem-Proving in ATS/LF</title>

<para>Within the ATS programming langauge system, there is a component
named ATS/LF for supporting (interactive) therorem-proving. In ATS/LF,
theorem-proving is done by constructing proofs as total functional
programs. It will soon become clear that this style of theorem-proving can
be combined cohesively with functional programming to yield a programming
paradigm that is considered the signature of ATS: <emphasis>programming
with theorem-proving</emphasis>. Moreover, ATS/LF can be employed to encode
various deduction systems and their meta-properties.</para>

<para>Please find <ulink url="http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/INTPROGINATS/CODE/CHAPTER_THMPRVING/">on-line</ulink>
the code employed for illustration in this chapter plus some additional
code for testing.</para>

<sect1 id="encoding_relations_as_dataprops">

<title>Encoding Relations as Dataprops</title>

<para>In the statics of ATS, there is a built-in sort
<emphasis>prop</emphasis> for static terms that represent types for
proofs. A static term of the sort <emphasis>prop</emphasis> can also be
referred to as a type or more accurately, a prop-type or just a prop. A
dataprop can be declared in a manner that is mostly similar to the
declaration of a datatype. For instance, a prop construct <code>FIB</code>
is introduced in the following dataprop declaration:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[dataprop FIB (int, int) =
  | FIB0 (0, 0) of () // [of ()] can be dropped
  | FIB1 (1, 1) of () // [of ()] can be dropped
  | {n:nat} {r0,r1:nat}
    FIB2 (n+2, r0+r1) of (FIB (n, r0), FIB (n+1, r1))
// end of [FIB]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


The sort assigned to <code>FIB</code> is <emphasis>(int, int) ->
prop</emphasis>, indicating that <code>FIB</code> takes two static integers
to form a prop-type. There are three data (or proof) constructors
associated with <code>FIB</code>: <code>FIB0</code>, <code>FIB1</code> and
<code>FIB2</code>, which are assigned the following function types (or more
accurately, prop-types):

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para><code>FIB0</code>: <code>() -> FIB (0, 0)</code>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>FIB1</code>: <code>() -> FIB (1, 1)</code>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>FIB2</code>:
 <code>{n:nat} {r0,r1:int} (FIB(n, r0), FIB(n+1, r1)) -> FIB(n+2, r0+r1)</code>
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

Given a natural number n and an integer r, it should be clear that
<code>FIB(n, r)</code> encodes the relation fib(n) = r, where fib is
defined by the following three equations:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>fib(0) = 0, and
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
fib(1) = 1, and
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>fib(n+2) = fib(n+1) + fib(n) for n >= 2.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

A proof value of the prop <code>FIB</code>(n, r) can be constructed if and
only if fib(n) equals r. For instance, the proof value <code>FIB2(FIB0(),
FIB1())</code> is assigned the prop <code>FIB(2, 1)</code>, attesting to fib(2)
equaling 1.</para><!--para-->

<para>As another example of dataprop, the following declaration introduces
a prop constructor <code>MUL</code> together with three associated proof
constructors:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[dataprop MUL (int, int, int) =
  | {n:int} MULbas (0, n, 0) of ()
  | {m:nat} {n:int} {p:int}
    MULind (m+1, n, p+n) of MUL (m, n, p)
  | {m:pos} {n:int} {p:int}
    MULneg (~m, n, ~p) of MUL (m, n, p)
// end of [MUL]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Given three integers m, n and p, the prop <code>MUL</code>(m, n, p)
encodes the relation m*n = p. As for <code>MULbas</code>, <code>MULind</code>
and <code>MULneg</code>, they correspond to the following three equations,
respectively:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>0*n = 0 for every integer n, and
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>(m+1)*n = m*n + n for each pair of integers m and n, and
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>(~m)*n = ~(m*n) for each pair of integers m and n.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

In other words, the dataprop declaration for <code>MUL</code> encodes the
relation that represents the standard multiplication function on integers.
</para>

<para>It can be readily noticed that the process of encoding a
functional relation (i.e., a relation representing a function) as a
dataprop is analogous to implementing a function in a logic programming
language such as Prolog.

<sect1 id="constructing_proofs_as_total_functions">

<title>Constructing Proofs as Total Functions</title>

<para>Theorems are represented as types (or more accurately, props) in
ATS/LF. For instance, the following prop states that integer multiplication
is commutative:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[{m,n:int} {p:int} MUL (m, n, p) -<prf> MUL (n, m, p)
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Constructing a proof for a theorem in ATS/LF means implementing a total
value (which is most likely to be a total function) of the type that is the
encoding of the theorem in ATS/LF, where being total means being pure and
terminating. Please note that this style of theorem-proving may seem rather
peculiar to those who have never tried it before.
</para><!--para-->

<para>As a simple introductory example, let us first construct a proof
function in ATS/LF that is given the following interface:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[prfun mut_istot {m,n:int} (): [p:int] MUL (m, n, p)
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


The keyword <code>prfun</code> indicates that the interface is for a proof
function (in contrast to a non-proof function).  Note that
<code>mul_istot</code> is declared to be of the following type (or more
accurately, prop):

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[{m,n:int} () -<prf> [p:int] MUL (m, n, p)
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


which essentially states that integer multiplication is a total function:
Given any two integers m and n, there exists an integer p such that m, n
and p are related according to the structurally inductively defined
relation <code>MUL</code>. The following code gives an implementation of
<code>mul_istot</code>:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[implement
mul_istot {m,n} () = let
  prfun istot
    {m:nat;n:int} .<m>. (): [p:int] MUL (m, n, p) =
    sif m > 0 then MULind (istot {m-1,n} ()) else MULbas ()
  // end of [istot]
in
  sif m >= 0 then istot {m,n} () else MULneg (istot {~m,n} ())
end // end of [mul_istot]  
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Note that the inner proof function <code>istot</code> encodes a proof
showing that there exists an integer p for any given natural number m and
integer n such that m, n and p are related (according to <code>MUL</code>).
The keyword <code>sif</code> is used for forming a conditional (proof)
expression in which the test is a static expression.  The proof encoded by
<code>istot</code> proceeds by induction on m; if m > 0 holds, then there
exists an integer p1 such that m-1, n and p1 are related by induction
hypothesis (on m-1) and thus m, n and p are related for p = p1+n according
to the rule encoded by <code>MULind</code>; if m = 0, then m, n and p are
related for p = 0. The proof encoded by the implementation of
<code>mul_istot</code> goes like this: if m is a natural number, then the
lemma proven by <code>istot</code> shows that m, n and some p are related;
if m is negative, then the same lemma shows that ~m, n and p1 are related
for some integer p1 and thus m, n and p are related for p = ~p1 according
to the rule encoded by <code>MULneg</code>.
</para><!--para-->

<para>As another example of theorem-proving in ATS/LF, a proof function of
the name <code>mul_isfun</code> is given as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[prfn mul_isfun
  {m,n:int} {p1,p2:int} (
  pf1: MUL (m, n, p1), pf2: MUL (m, n, p2)
) : [p1==p2] void = let
  prfun isfun
    {m:nat;n:int} {p1,p2:int} .<m>. (
    pf1: MUL (m, n, p1), pf2: MUL (m, n, p2)
  ) : [p1==p2] void =
    case+ pf1 of
    | MULind (pf1prev) => let
        prval MULind (pf2prev) = pf2 in isfun (pf1prev, pf2prev)
      end // end of [MULind]
    | MULbas () => let
        prval MULbas () = pf2 in ()
      end // end of [MULbas]
  // end of [isfun]
in
  case+ pf1 of
  | MULneg (pf1nat) => let
      prval MULneg (pf2nat) = pf2 in isfun (pf1nat, pf2nat)
    end // end of [MULneg]
  | _ =>> isfun (pf1, pf2)
end // end of [mul_isfun]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


The keyword <code>prfn</code> is used for defining a non-recursive proof
function, and the keyword <code>prval</code> for introducing bindings that
relate names to proof expressions, that is, expressions of prop-types. As
far as pattern matching exhaustiveness is concerned, <code>prval</code> is
equivalent to <code>val+</code> (as proofs cannot contain any effects such
as failures of pattern matching).
</para>

<para>What <code>mul_isfun</code> proves is that the relation
<code>MUL</code> is functional on its first two arguments: If m, n and p1
are related according to <code>MUL</code> and m, n and p2 are also related
according to <code>MUL</code>, then p1 and p2 are equal.  The statement is
first proven by the inner proof function <code>isfun</code> under the
assumption that m is a natural number, and then the assumption is dropped.
Let us now take a look at the first matching clause in the body of
<code>isfun</code>. If the clause is chosen, then <code>pf1</code> matches
the pattern <code>MULind(pf1prev)</code> and thus <code>pf1prev</code> is
of the type <code>MUL(m1, n1, q1)</code> for some natural number m1 and
integer n1 and integer p1 such that m=m1+1, n=n1, and p1=q1+n1. This means
that <code>pf2</code> must be of the form <code>MULind(pf2prev)</code> for
some <code>pf2prev</code> of the type <code>MUL(m2, n2, q2)</code> such
that m2+1=m, n2=n and p2=q2+n2. By calling <code>isfun</code> on
<code>pf1prev</code> and <code>pf2prev</code>, which amounts to invoking
the induction hypothesis on m-1, we establish q1=q2, which implies
p1=p2. The second matching clause in the body of <code>isfun</code> can be
readily understood, which corresponds to the base case in the inductive
proof encoded by <code>isfun</code>.
</para>

<sect1 id="example_proving_distributivity_of_multiplication">
<title>Example: Proving Distributivity of Multiplication</title>

<para>The distributivity of multiplication over addition means that the following
equation holds

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[m * (n1 + n2) = m * n1 + m * n2
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


for m, n1 and n2 ranging over integers. Clearly, a direct encoding of the equation
is given by the following (proof) function interface:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[extern
prfun mul_distribute {m:int} {n1,n2:int} {p1,p2:int}
  (pf1: MUL (m, n1, p1), pf2: MUL (m, n2, p2)): MUL (m, n1+n2, p1+p2)
// end of [mul_distribute]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Plainly speaking, the encoding states that the product of m and (n1+n2) is
p1+p2 if the product of m and n1 is p1 and the product of m and n2 is p2.
An implementation of <code>mul_distribute</code> is given as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[implement
mul_distribute
  {m} {n1,n2} {p1,p2} (pf1, pf2) = let
  prfun aux
    {m:nat}
    {n1,n2:int}
    {p1,p2:int}
    .<m>. (
    pf1: MUL (m, n1, p1), pf2: MUL (m, n2, p2)
  ) : MUL (m, n1+n2, p1+p2) =
    case+ (pf1, pf2) of
    | (MULbas (), MULbas ()) => MULbas ()
    | (MULind pf1, MULind pf2) => MULind (aux (pf1, pf2))
  // end of [aux]
in
  sif m >= 0 then
    aux (pf1, pf2)
  else let
    prval MULneg (pf1) = pf1
    prval MULneg (pf2) = pf2
  in
    MULneg (aux (pf1, pf2))
  end
end // end of [mul_distribute]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


In essence, the inner function <code>aux</code> encodes a straighforward
proof based on mathematical induction that establishes the following
equation:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[m * (n1 + n2) = m * n1 + m * n2
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


for m ranging over natural numbers and n1 and n2 ranging over integers. The
function <code>mul_distribute</code> can then be implemented immediately
based on <code>aux</code>.
</para>

<sect1 id="datasorts">
<title>Datasorts</title>

<para>A datasort is rather similar to a dataype. However, the former is
declared in the statics of ATS while the latter in the dynamics of ATS. To
see a typical need for datasorts, let us try to encode a theorem in ATS
stating that s is strictly less than 2<superscript>h</superscript> if s and
h are the size and height, respectively, of a given binary tree. To
represent binary trees in the statics, we first declare a datasort as
follows:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[datasort tree = E of () | B of (tree, tree)
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


The name of the declared datasort is <code>tree</code> and there are two
constructor associated with it: E and B, where E forms the empty tree and B
forms a tree by joining two given trees.  For instance, B(E(), E()) is a
static term of the sort <code>tree</code> that represents a singleton tree,
that is, a tree consisting of exactly one node.  Please note that the trees formed
by E and B are really just tree skeletons carrying no data.
</para>

<para>We now declare two dataprops as follows for capturing the notion of
size and height of trees:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[dataprop SZ (tree, int) =
  | SZE (E (), 0) of ()
  | {tl,tr:tree} {sl,sr:nat}
    SZB (B (tl, tr), 1+sl+sr) of (SZ (tl, sl), SZ (tr, sr))
// end of [SZ]

dataprop HT (tree, int) =
  | HTE (E (), 0) of ()
  | {tl,tr:tree} {hl,hr:nat}
    HTB (B (tl, tr), 1+max(hl,hr)) of (HT (tl, hl), HT (tr, hr))
// end of [HT]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Given a tree t and an integer s, SZ(t, s) encodes the relation that the
size of t equals s. Similiarly, given a tree t and an integer h, HZ(t, h)
encodes the relation that the height of t equals h.
</para>

<para>As the power function (of base 2) is not available in the statics of ATS,
we declare a dataprop as follows to capture it:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[dataprop POW2 (int, int) =
  | POW2bas (0, 1)
  | {n:nat} {p:int} POW2ind (n+1, p+p) of POW2 (n, p)
// end of [POW2]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Given two integers h and p, POW2 (h, p) encodes the relation that
2<superscript>h</superscript> equals p.
</para>

<para>It should be clear by now that the following proof function
interface encodes the theorem stating that s is strictly less than
2<superscript>h</superscript> if s and h are the size and height of a
given binary tree:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[extern
prfun lemma_tree_size_height
  {t:tree} {s,h:nat} {p:int} (
  pf1: SZ (t, s), pf2: HT (t, h), pf3: POW2 (h, p)
) : [s < p] void // end of [prfun]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Let us now construct an implementation of this proof function as follows.
</para><!--para-->

<para>We first establish some elementary properties on the power function
(of base 2):

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[prfun pow2_istot
  {h:nat} .<h>. (): [p:int] POW2 (h, p) =
  sif h > 0 then POW2ind (pow2_istot {h-1} ()) else POW2bas ()
// end of [pow2_istot]

prfun pow2_pos
  {h:nat} {p:int} .<h>.
  (pf: POW2 (h, p)): [p > 0] void =
  case+ pf of
  | POW2ind (pf1) => pow2_pos (pf1) | POW2bas () => ()
// end of [pow2_pos]

prfun pow2_inc
  {h1,h2:nat | h1 <= h2} {p1,p2:int} .<h2>.
  (pf1: POW2 (h1, p1), pf2: POW2 (h2, p2)): [p1 <= p2] void =
  case+ pf1 of
  | POW2ind (pf11) => let
      prval POW2ind (pf21) = pf2 in pow2_inc (pf11, pf21)
    end
  | POW2bas () => pow2_pos (pf2)
// end of [pow2_inc]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Clearly, <code>pow2_istot</code> shows that the relation encoded by the
dataprop <code>POW2</code> is a total relation; <code>pow2_pos</code>
proves that the power of each natural number is positive;
<code>pow2_inc</code> establishes that the power function is increasing.
</para>

<para>The function <code>lemma_tree_size_height</code> can be implemented
as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[implement
lemma_tree_size_height
  (pf1, pf2, pf3) = let
//
prfun lemma
  {t:tree} {s,h:nat} {p:int} .<t>. (
  pf1: SZ (t, s), pf2: HT (t, h), pf3: POW2 (h, p)
) : [p > s] void =
  scase t of
  | B (tl, tr) => let
      prval SZB (pf1l, pf1r) = pf1
      prval HTB {tl,tr} {hl,hr} (pf2l, pf2r) = pf2
      prval POW2ind (pf31) = pf3
      prval pf3l = pow2_istot {hl} ()
      prval pf3r = pow2_istot {hr} ()
      prval () = lemma (pf1l, pf2l, pf3l)
      prval () = lemma (pf1r, pf2r, pf3r)
      prval () = pow2_inc (pf3l, pf31)
      prval () = pow2_inc (pf3r, pf31)
    in
      // nothing
    end // end of [B]
  | E () => let
      prval SZE () = pf1
      prval HTE () = pf2
      prval POW2bas () = pf3
   in
     // nothing
   end // end of [E]
//
in
  lemma (pf1, pf2, pf3)
end // end of [lemma_tree_size_height]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


The inner function <code>lemma</code>, which is given a termination metric
consisting of a static term of the sort <code>tree</code>, corresponds to a
proof based on structural induction (where the involved structure is the
binary tree <code>t</code>).  Given two terms t1 and t2 of the sort
<code>tree</code>, t1 is (strictly) less than t2 if t1 is a (proper)
substructure of t2. Evidently, this is a well-founded ordering.  The
keyword <code>scase</code> is used to form a dynamic expression that does
case-analysis on a static term (built by constructors associated with some
declared datasort). So the relation between <code>sif</code> and <code>scase</code>
is essentially parallel to that between <code>if</code> and <code>case</code>.

<sect1 id="example_proving_properties_on_braun_trees">
<title>Example: Proving Properties on Braun Trees</title>
<para>As stated previously in this book, a binary tree is a Braun tree if
it is empty or if its left and right subtrees are Braun trees and
the size of the left one minus the size of the right one is either 0 or 1.
Formally, we can declare the following dataprop <code>isBraun</code> to
capture the notion of Braun trees:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[dataprop isBraun (tree) =
  | isBraunE (E) of ()
  | {tl,tr:tree}
    {sl,sr:nat | sr <= sl; sl <= sr + 1}
    isBraunB (
      B(tl, tr)) of (isBraun tl, isBraun tr, SZ (tl, sl), SZ (tr, sr)
    ) // end of [isBraunB]
// end of [isBraun]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>

</para>

<para>We first prove that there exists a Braun tree of any given size.
This property can be encoded as follows in ATS:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[extern
prfun lemma_existence {n:nat} (): [t:tree] (isBraun (t), SZ (t, n))
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Literally, the type assigned to <code>lemma_existence</code> means that there
exists a tree t for any given natural number n such that t is a Braun tree
and the size of t is n. The following code gives an implementation of
<code>lemma_existence</code>:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[implement
lemma_existence {n} () = let
  prfun lemma {n:nat} .<n>.
    (): [t:tree] (isBraun (t), SZ (t, n)) =
    sif n > 0 then let
      stadef nl = n / 2 // size for the left subtree
      stadef nr = n - 1 - nl // size for the right subtree
      val (pfl1, pfl2) = lemma {nl} ()
      and (pfr1, pfr2) = lemma {nr} ()
    in
      (isBraunB (pfl1, pfr1, pfl2, pfr2), SZB (pfl2, pfr2))
    end else
      (isBraunE (), SZE ())
    // end of [sif]
in
  lemma {n} ()
end // end of [lemma_existence]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Note that <code>stadef</code> is a keyword in ATS for introducting a static
binding between a name and a static term (of any sort). If one prefers,
this keyword can be chosen to replace the keyword <code>typedef</code> (for
introducing a name and a static term of the sort <code>t@ype</code>).

</para><!--para-->

<para>Next we show that two Braun trees of the same size are identical. This
property can be encoded as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[extern
prfun lemma_unicity {n:nat} {t1,t2:tree} (
  pf1: isBraun t1, pf2: isBraun t2, pf3: SZ (t1, n), pf4: SZ (t2, n)
) : EQ (t1, t2) // end of [lemma_unicity]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


where <code>EQ</code> is a prop-constructor introduced by the following
dataprop declaration:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[dataprop EQ (tree, tree) =
  | EQE (E, E) of ()
  | {t1l,t1r:tree} {t2l,t2r:tree}
    EQB (B (t1l, t1r), B (t2l, t2r)) of (EQ (t1l, t2l), EQ (t1r, t2r))
// end of [EQ]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Clearly, <code>EQ</code> is the inductively defined equality on trees.
An implementation of the proof function <code>lemma_unicity</code> is presented
as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[implement
lemma_unicity (pf1, pf2, pf3, pf4) = let
  prfun lemma {n:nat} {t1,t2:tree} .<n>. (
    pf1: isBraun t1, pf2: isBraun t2, pf3: SZ (t1, n), pf4: SZ (t2, n)
  ) : EQ (t1, t2) =
    sif n > 0 then let
      prval SZB (pf3l, pf3r) = pf3
      prval SZB (pf4l, pf4r) = pf4
      prval isBraunB (pf1l, pf1r, pf1lsz, pf1rsz) = pf1
      prval isBraunB (pf2l, pf2r, pf2lsz, pf2rsz) = pf2
      prval () = SZ_istot (pf1lsz, pf3l) and () = SZ_istot (pf1rsz, pf3r)
      prval () = SZ_istot (pf2lsz, pf4l) and () = SZ_istot (pf2rsz, pf4r)
      prval pfeql = lemma (pf1l, pf2l, pf3l, pf4l)
      prval pfeqr = lemma (pf1r, pf2r, pf3r, pf4r)
    in
      EQB (pfeql, pfeqr)
    end else let
      prval SZE () = pf3 and SZE () = pf4
      prval isBraunE () = pf1 and isBraunE () = pf2
    in
      EQE ()
    end // end of [sif]
in
  lemma (pf1, pf2, pf3, pf4)
end // end of [lemma_unicity]
]]></programlisting></informalexample>


Note that the proof function <code>SZ_istot</code> in this implementation of
<code>lemma_unicity</code> is given the following interface:

which simply states that <code>SZ</code> is a functional relation with respect
to its first parameter, that is, there is at most one n for every given t
such that t and n are related according to <code>SZ</code>.

Clearly, the mathematical proof corresponding to this implementation is of
induction on the size n of the two given trees t1 and t2. In the base case
where n is 0, t1 and t2 are equal as they both are the empty tree. In the
inductive case where n > 0, it is proven that n1l and n2l are of the same
value where n1l and n2l are the sizes of the left subtrees of t1 and t2,
respecitvely; similarly, it is also proven that n1r and n2r are of the same
value where n1r and n2r are the sizes of the right subtrees of t1 and t2,
respectively; by induction hypothesis on n1l, the left substrees of t1 and
t2 are the same; by induction hypothesis on n1r, the right substrees of t1
and t2 are the same; by the definition of tree equality (encoded by
<code>EQ</code>), t1 and t2 are the same.</para><!--para-->

<para>As a comparison, the following code gives another implementation of
<code>lemma_unicity</code> that is of a different (and rather unusual) style:

<informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[implement
lemma_unicity (pf1, pf2, pf3, pf4) = let
  prfun lemma {n:nat} {t1,t2:tree} .<t1>. (
    pf1: isBraun t1, pf2: isBraun t2, pf3: SZ (t1, n), pf4: SZ (t2, n)
  ) : EQ (t1, t2) =
    case+ (pf1, pf2) of
    | (isBraunE (), isBraunE ()) => EQE ()
    | (isBraunB (pf11, pf12, pf13, pf14),
       isBraunB (pf21, pf22, pf23, pf24)) => let
//

        prval SZB (pf41, pf42) = pf4

This implementation corresponds to a proof by induction on the structure of
the given tree t1. Note that the use of the special symbol <code>=/=></code>,
which is a keyword in ATS, is to indicate to the typechecker of ATS that
the involved clause of patter matching is <emphasis>unreachable</emphasis>: It is the
responsibility of the programmer to establish the falsehood on the
right-hand side of the clause. Please find the entirety of the above code
